# Research Page Redesign Concept

For the **Research Page**, I propose transforming it from a standard article into an interactive technical report.

### 1. Hero Section
- **Background:** `AnimatedGridPattern` (subtle green/emerald tint) to signal "technical/data".
- **Title:** "Generation Loss" using `TextAnimate` (slide up).
- **Subtitle:** Glass badge displaying "Technical Analysis".

### 2. Key Findings (Bento Grid)
Replace the simple list with a **Bento Grid** layout for the 3 core findings:
- **Card 1 (Large):** "Opus is King" - Highlight 251 itag specs.
- **Card 2 (Small):** "AAC Caps" - Visualizing the 16kHz cut-off.
- **Card 3 (Small):** "Transcoding Waste" - Stat about 250% file size bloat.
*All cards using `ShineBorder` on hover.*

### 3. "The Myth" Section (Feature)
- A focused section with `BorderBeam` around the "320kbps Myth" explanation to draw attention to the core value prop.
- The comparison table (Opus vs AAC) restyled as a transparent glass table.

**Does this direction for the Research page look good?**
A. **Yes, perfect** - Proceed with this structure.
B. **Too complex** - Keep the text more readable, less "bento".
C. **More visual** - Add more diagrams/beams.
