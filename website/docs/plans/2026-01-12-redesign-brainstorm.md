I'd like to rework the Research and Tutorial pages to match the Home page's modern, glassmorphic aesthetic using your existing components (`bento-grid`, `animated-beam`, `animated-grid-pattern`).

**Does this align with your vision?**

*   **Yes, match the Home page style** (Glass, gradients, animations)
*   **No, keep them simple/minimal** (Focus purely on readability)
*   **Something else** (Please specify)
